# Shopping Cart Project

Checkout button in Cart intentionally not working. 

Technologies:

React:

Hooks: useState, useEffect, useContext, useLayoutEffect
createContext
Router: BrowserRouter, Switch, Route, exact path

JS:

Methods: .map, .filter, .reduce, .toFixed
ternary operators
fetch()

Things I learned:

1. React Router
2. Context api
3. Adding a property on fetch
4. Setting Context with more than one state
5. useLayoutEffect
6. Making tabs active based on click (in Nav) and page loaded (for reload with useEffect)
